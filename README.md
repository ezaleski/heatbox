# heatbox

This is a set of python scripts and and a web interface that I wrote to control a custom LED 4 digit display that I built.

It is intended to run on a raspberry pi with the leds connected via the GPIO ports.  I also have a keypad that I have connected as well which will be used to control the display as well.

It is also currently in progress and not yet functional.
